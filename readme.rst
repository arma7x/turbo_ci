What is TurboCI
###################

TurboCI built on top of CodeIgniter, CodeIgniter is an Application Development 
Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is 
to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were 
writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly 
needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access 
these libraries. CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by 
minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
